#Computer Vision (Deep learning)

- This sections teaches more modern CV methods that use deep learning.

### Course
 - In order to learn this subject comprehensively this section is based on michigan's university deep learning for computer vision [course](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/), it is the spiritual successor to stanford's c231.
 - Watch the lectures, and do **all** of the assignments.
 - For your convenience, here is some useful information:
    - The course lectures are on youtube - link in the main course page
    - Use Google Collab to train your models - because Collab is limited for free users, we recommend to switch between 2 google accounts while working.
    - For your convenience, the assignments are in the folder "Assignments" 

### Reading Articles
 - One of the main aspects of research is the ability to read and extract useful information from academic articles. In this exercise you will practice these skills on a classic series of papers: RCNN.
 - In the exercise, you will read the paper one by one and then be tested about your knowledge by your instructor.
 - The exercise steps are mainly:
    - Read **thoroughly** the RCNN paper and understand everything about it.
    - After you have read everything you can, inform your instructor and schedule the test.
    - If there will be unanswered questions during the test, find the answers and reschedule with your instructor.
    - Once your instructor permits you to advance, repeat these steps with Fast and Faster-RCNN, reading each one and then being tested on it.
 - Important remarks:
     - You are expected to understand everything in the paper, including things that are beyond of the scope of the paper, read as much as you can before scheduling a test.
     - Main things that you want to understand:
        - the algorithm itself (of course)
        - previous work
        - the datasets that the network is being trained/tested on
        - results, comparisons to other works
        - evaluation metrics
        - strength and weaknesses of the algorithm 
     - Other sources that you may want to read:
        - other papers
        - blog posts and discussions
        - source code
     - We are aware that this exercise may be frustrating and/or impractical, the aim of this exercise is to teach you every possible way to extract information for research. You don't need to and shouldn't be that thorough in future research.
     - Take into account that the focus is on the first paper, after that the test is much more in line with ordinary research questions.
