# DevOps training
This is an introduction to the basic DevOps tools that are required for working in the development environment.

####DevOps:

    - Read "linux_reading_material", and answer the questions in pages 10, 16, 18.
    - It is preferable that you will work in a linux environment (ask the team), but it is possible to work in an online terminal [here](https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=https://bellard.org/jslinux/buildroot-x86.cfg).
 
 - **Git** - 
    - Read about git [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials), and do the exercises [here](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - focus on commit,push,pull.
    - it is recommended to open your repository on your work computer and clone this training
